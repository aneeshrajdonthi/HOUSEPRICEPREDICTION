# House Price Prediction - Bangalore

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house and land prices in Bangalore using **machine learning algorithms**. By gathering real estate data from multiple sources, cleaning, and analyzing it, we aim to provide accurate price estimations. The insights gained from this project can help buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** Gathered real estate data from various sources.
- **Data Cleaning & Analysis:** Processed raw data using Python, Microsoft Excel, and Jupyter Notebook.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created meaningful features to improve model accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Applied ML algorithms to train and predict house prices.
- **Visualization & Insights:** Generated charts and reports to better understand market trends.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- **Microsoft Excel** (for initial data exploration and preprocessing)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for model development and analysis)

## Installation & Usage
### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open the `house_price_prediction.ipynb` file and execute the cells step by step.

### 4. Predict House Prices:
You can input new data into the trained model to predict house prices based on features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.

## Dataset Details
- **Location:** Bangalore
- **Features:** Area (sqft), Number of bedrooms, Number of bathrooms, Price, etc.
- **Target Variable:** House Price (in INR)

## Results & Insights
- The model provides accurate house price predictions based on given inputs.
- Real estate trends in Bangalore suggest that certain localities have higher property appreciation rates.
- Feature importance analysis reveals that **location and area (sqft)** significantly impact house prices.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating more real-time real estate data.
- Deploying the model using a web application (Flask/Django) for better usability.
- Adding more advanced machine learning models for improved accuracy.
